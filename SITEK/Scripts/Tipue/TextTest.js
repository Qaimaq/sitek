Why we offer Mechanical Completion & Commissioning Services? Mechanical Completion & Commissioning appear at the end of the project, not continuously during life-cycle of a company; on-field experience shows that for Company (Main Contractors and Oil Company) is not always convenient to deploy “in-house” but they outsource (database, coordinators, supervisors, technicians). It’s a critical process, it’s bottleneck of all disciplines (Civil, Structure, Piping, E&I, Painting) and all phases (Engineering, Procurement, Construction). Projects schedules are always tight, and the overlap with construction causes with huge impact on progress.
